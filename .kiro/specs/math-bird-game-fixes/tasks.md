- [x] 2. Modify obstacle generation to sync with questions
  - Update GameEngine obstacle generation to pair obstacles with locked questions
  - Ensure only closest obstacle is associated with current question
  - Add question change trigger only after obstacle interaction
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

## Obstacle Navigation Enhancement

- [x] 3. Remove physical barriers between answer zones
  - Modify MathObstacle collision detection to exclude gap between answer zones
  - Implement pass-through zone between upper and lower answer areas
  - Update collision bounds to allow navigation between answer choices
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 4. Increase vertical separation between answer zones
  - Adjust answer zone positioning to provide sufficient vertical separation
  - Ensure gap between answer choices is clearly passable
  - Update touch-friendly sizing for mobile devices
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

## Visual Neutrality Implementation

- [x] 5. Standardize answer choice colors to blue theme
  - Replace current green/red color scheme with uniform blue styling
  - Remove visual indicators of correctness from MathObstacle rendering
  - Apply consistent styling across all answer zones
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 6. Update answer zone styling for neutrality
  - Modify renderAnswerZone method to use neutral blue gradients
  - Remove isCorrect-based color differentiation
  - Ensure both answer choices appear visually identical
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

## Feedback System Enhancement

- [x] 7. Implement clear post-selection feedback
  - Enhance FeedbackDisplay component to show correct answer when wrong
  - Add prominent feedback positioning without obstructing gameplay
  - Implement 1-2 second feedback duration with proper timing
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 8. Add correct answer display for incorrect selections
  - Modify AnswerHandler to include correct answer in incorrect feedback
  - Update feedback messages to show what the correct answer was
  - Ensure feedback provides educational value
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.5_

## Game Pacing Improvements

- [x] 9. Increase obstacle spacing by 50%
  - Update OBSTACLE_SPAWN_DISTANCE in gameConfig from 300 to 450
  - Modify obstacle generation spacing calculations accordingly
  - Ensure consistent spacing regardless of difficulty progression
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5_

- [x] 10. Verify pacing doesn't impact game smoothness
  - Test obstacle generation with increased spacing
  - Ensure performance remains optimal with new spacing
  - Validate that educational focus is maintained
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.5_

## Statistics Accuracy Fixes

- [x] 11. Fix statistics tracking accuracy
  - Review and correct any discrepancies in totalCorrect/totalIncorrect counting
  - Ensure real-time statistics calculation prevents accumulation errors
  - Verify accuracy percentage calculation is correct (correct/total * 100)
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 12. Enhance game over statistics display
  - Ensure final score matches accumulated gameplay score
  - Add highest streak tracking throughout the session
  - Verify all statistics are accurately reflected in GameOverScreen
  - _Requirements: 6.5, 6.6_

## Integration and Testing

- [x] 13. Create comprehensive integration tests
  - Test complete question-answer-feedback cycle with new synchronization
  - Verify obstacle navigation improvements work correctly
  - Test statistics accuracy across multiple game sessions
  - _Requirements: All requirements integration testing_

- [x] 14. Update existing tests for new functionality
  - Modify MathObstacle tests for new neutral styling
  - Update GameEngine tests for new spacing configuration
  - Add tests for QuestionSyncManager functionality
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [x] 15. Performance testing with all fixes
  - Verify game performance with increased obstacle spacing
  - Test feedback system doesn't impact frame rate
  - Ensure mobile performance remains optimal
  - _Requirements: 5.5, performance validation_
