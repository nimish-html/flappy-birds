# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical usability and gameplay issues in the existing Math Bird game to improve the player experience and educational effectiveness. The fixes focus on question-obstacle synchronization, obstacle design improvements, visual feedback enhancements, game pacing adjustments, and accurate end-game statistics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want each question to remain stable until I answer it by passing through an obstacle, so that I can focus on solving the math problem without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a math question is displayed THEN it SHALL remain unchanged until the player passes through the corresponding obstacle
2. WHEN a new obstacle appears THEN it SHALL be paired with the current displayed question
3. WHEN the player passes through an obstacle THEN the question SHALL change to the next one
4. WHEN multiple obstacles are on screen THEN only the closest obstacle SHALL be associated with the current question
5. WHEN the game starts THEN the first question SHALL be displayed before the first obstacle appears

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to navigate through answer choices without hitting unavoidable barriers, so that my success depends on choosing the correct answer rather than precise positioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN obstacles are generated THEN there SHALL be no physical barrier between the upper and lower answer zones
2. WHEN the player flies between answer zones THEN they SHALL be able to pass through without collision
3. WHEN answer zones are positioned THEN they SHALL have sufficient vertical separation for easy navigation
4. WHEN obstacles are rendered THEN the gap between answer choices SHALL be clearly passable
5. WHEN collision detection occurs THEN it SHALL only trigger on the outer obstacle boundaries, not between answer zones

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want both answer choices to appear visually neutral, so that I must rely on my math knowledge rather than visual cues to determine the correct answer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN answer choices are displayed THEN both SHALL use the same blue color scheme
2. WHEN answers are rendered THEN there SHALL be no visual indication of which is correct or incorrect
3. WHEN the player selects an answer THEN feedback SHALL be provided after selection, not before
4. WHEN answer zones are styled THEN they SHALL be visually identical except for the numerical content
5. WHEN colors are applied THEN they SHALL not provide hints about answer correctness

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear feedback after making an answer choice, so that I can learn from my decisions and understand my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player selects the correct answer THEN the system SHALL display positive feedback (e.g., "Correct!")
2. WHEN the player selects the incorrect answer THEN the system SHALL display negative feedback (e.g., "Incorrect!")
3. WHEN feedback is shown THEN it SHALL be visible for 1-2 seconds without blocking gameplay
4. WHEN feedback appears THEN it SHALL be positioned prominently but not obstruct the game view
5. WHEN feedback is displayed THEN it SHALL clearly indicate the correct answer if the player was wrong

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want more time to read and consider each math question, so that the game feels educational rather than rushed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN obstacles are generated THEN the horizontal distance between them SHALL be increased by at least 50%
2. WHEN the game is running THEN players SHALL have adequate time to read questions and plan their approach
3. WHEN obstacle spacing is calculated THEN it SHALL account for question complexity and reading time
4. WHEN the game difficulty progresses THEN obstacle spacing SHALL remain consistent for learning focus
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN the increased spacing SHALL not negatively impact game smoothness

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want accurate performance statistics on the game over screen, so that I can track my learning progress effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game ends THEN the summary SHALL display the correct number of questions answered
2. WHEN statistics are calculated THEN the correct answer count SHALL match actual correct selections
3. WHEN the incorrect answer count is shown THEN it SHALL accurately reflect wrong selections
4. WHEN the accuracy percentage is displayed THEN it SHALL be calculated correctly (correct/total * 100)
5. WHEN the final score is shown THEN it SHALL match the score accumulated during gameplay
6. WHEN streak information is displayed THEN it SHALL show the highest streak achieved during the session
