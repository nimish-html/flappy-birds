  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6_

- [x] 3. Create enhanced obstacle system with dual answer zones
  - Extend existing Obstacle class to create MathObstacle with upper and lower answer zones
  - Implement answer zone positioning and collision detection logic
  - Add random answer placement (upper/lower) to prevent pattern memorization
  - Create visual rendering system for answer choices within obstacle gaps
  - Write unit tests for answer zone collision detection and visual positioning
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5_

- [x] 4. Implement question display system
  - Create UI component for displaying math questions at the top-center of screen
  - Ensure question text uses large, legible fonts for gameplay readability
  - Implement question loading and display synchronization with obstacle generation
  - Add responsive text scaling for different screen sizes
  - Write unit tests for question display rendering and positioning
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 5. Integrate math system with game engine
  - Modify GameEngine to incorporate MathQuestionManager and ScoringSystem
  - Implement question lifecycle management (load → display → validate → next)
  - Add answer selection detection when bird passes through answer zones
  - Ensure proper synchronization between question display and obstacle generation
  - Write integration tests for complete question-to-scoring flow
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.4, 4.6, 6.1_

- [x] 6. Implement answer validation and feedback system
  - Create AnswerHandler class to process correct and incorrect answer selections
  - Add visual and/or audio feedback for answer selection (correct/incorrect/bonus)
  - Implement feedback timing to not interfere with ongoing gameplay
  - Add special effects for streak bonus achievements
  - Write unit tests for answer validation and feedback triggering
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

- [x] 7. Update game state management for math integration
  - Modify game state to track current question, score, and streak data
  - Ensure game-over screen displays final score and math performance stats
  - Maintain traditional collision detection for pipes and ground (game-over behavior)
  - Add game restart functionality that resets math state appropriately
  - Write unit tests for game state transitions and data persistence
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 8. Create comprehensive test suite for math game functionality
  - Write integration tests for complete gameplay sessions across question categories
  - Add end-to-end tests verifying question pool management over extended play
  - Test collision behavior to ensure traditional game-over mechanics are preserved
  - Add performance tests for smooth rendering with math UI elements
  - Create accessibility tests for question readability and answer zone visibility
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [x] 9. Optimize performance and mobile responsiveness
  - Optimize answer zone collision detection for smooth gameplay
  - Implement efficient question text rendering and caching
  - Ensure touch-friendly answer zone sizes for mobile devices
  - Add responsive scaling for question display on different screen sizes
  - Write performance tests to verify smooth 60fps gameplay with math elements
  - _Requirements: 7.4, 7.5, 8.4_

- [x] 10. Final integration and polish
  - Integrate all math components with existing game systems
  - Ensure seamless transition between traditional Flappy Bird mechanics and math features
  - Add final visual polish for answer displays and question presentation
  - Conduct comprehensive testing across all game scenarios
  - Verify all requirements are met through final validation testing
  - _Requirements: All requirements final validation_
