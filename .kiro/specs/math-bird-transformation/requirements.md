# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves transforming the existing Flappy Bird game into "Math Bird" - an educational math game that combines classic arcade game-over mechanics with a continuous, score-based math challenge where players answer questions to accumulate points. The game will feature a persistent question display, answer choices within obstacle gaps, dynamic scoring with streak bonuses, and a knowledge base of 200 math questions across four categories (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see math questions displayed at the top of the screen, so that I can prepare to answer them while navigating.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN a math question SHALL be displayed prominently at the top-center of the screen
2. WHEN the player successfully passes through an answer zone THEN a new math question SHALL be loaded and displayed for the next obstacle
3. WHEN the question text is displayed THEN it SHALL be in a large, legible font that is easily readable during gameplay
4. WHEN the game is running THEN the question SHALL remain visible and stationary at the top of the screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to answer math questions by choosing between two paths through obstacles, so that I can demonstrate my math knowledge while playing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an obstacle is generated THEN it SHALL contain two distinct answer zones (upper and lower paths)
2. WHEN answer choices are displayed THEN one SHALL be the correct answer and one SHALL be incorrect
3. WHEN answer choices are positioned THEN they SHALL be randomly assigned to upper or lower zones to prevent pattern memorization
4. WHEN the bird passes through an answer zone THEN the system SHALL detect which answer was chosen
5. WHEN answer zones are rendered THEN they SHALL be clearly visible with distinct boxes containing the answer numbers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to end when I hit physical obstacles, so that it maintains the classic arcade challenge while focusing learning on answer selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bird collides with pipes or ground THEN the game SHALL end with a game-over screen
2. WHEN a collision occurs THEN the traditional game-over mechanics SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN the game ends THEN the player SHALL be able to restart and continue learning
4. WHEN physical collisions happen THEN they SHALL be treated as terminal events separate from answer selection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to earn points for correct answers and build up streaks, so that I feel rewarded for my math skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I choose the correct answer THEN I SHALL earn 10 points
2. WHEN I choose the correct answer THEN my streak counter SHALL increment by 1
3. WHEN I achieve a streak of 5 correct answers THEN I SHALL earn a 50-point bonus
4. WHEN I choose an incorrect answer THEN I SHALL lose 5 points (minimum score of 0)
5. WHEN I choose an incorrect answer THEN my streak SHALL reset to 0
6. WHEN my score changes THEN it SHALL be displayed in real-time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want access to a diverse set of math questions, so that the game remains educational and challenging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game initializes THEN it SHALL have access to 200 pre-defined math questions
2. WHEN questions are categorized THEN there SHALL be 50 questions each for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
3. WHEN questions are selected THEN they SHALL follow a smooth difficulty curve within each category
4. WHEN a question is used THEN it SHALL not repeat until all other available questions have been used
5. WHEN all questions have been used THEN the question pool SHALL reset and reshuffle

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want intelligent question management, so that I don't see the same questions repeatedly in a short time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question is selected THEN it SHALL be moved from available to used pool
2. WHEN the available question pool is empty THEN used questions SHALL be reshuffled back to available
3. WHEN questions are selected THEN they SHALL be chosen randomly from the available pool
4. WHEN the game starts THEN all 200 questions SHALL be available for selection
5. WHEN question management occurs THEN it SHALL prevent immediate repetition of questions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear visual separation between answer choices, so that I can easily distinguish between the two options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN obstacles are rendered THEN there SHALL be two distinct answer boxes within the pipe structure
2. WHEN answer boxes are displayed THEN they SHALL have clear visual boundaries and backgrounds
3. WHEN the two paths are shown THEN there SHALL be a visible separator (horizontal pipe piece) between upper and lower zones
4. WHEN answers are rendered THEN the numbers SHALL be clearly visible within their respective boxes
5. WHEN obstacles move THEN the answer displays SHALL remain properly aligned and readable

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want responsive feedback when I make choices, so that I understand the consequences of my answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I choose the correct answer THEN there SHALL be positive visual or audio feedback
2. WHEN I choose the incorrect answer THEN there SHALL be negative visual or audio feedback  
3. WHEN I achieve a streak bonus THEN there SHALL be special bonus effect feedback
4. WHEN feedback is provided THEN it SHALL not interfere with ongoing gameplay
5. WHEN effects are displayed THEN they SHALL be brief and clear
