# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Flappy Bird game using Next.js. The game will feature a bird that automatically moves forward with gravity physics, obstacles of variable heights, a live scoring system, and game over functionality with restart capability. The game should provide an engaging, browser-based gaming experience with smooth animations and responsive controls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control a bird that automatically moves forward, so that I can focus on navigating through obstacles.

3. WHEN no input is provided THEN the bird SHALL maintain its forward momentum without stopping

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the bird to be affected by gravity, so that the game feels realistic and challenging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is running THEN the bird SHALL continuously fall downward due to gravity
2. WHEN the player clicks or presses a key THEN the bird SHALL jump upward against gravity
3. WHEN the bird jumps THEN gravity SHALL still apply, causing the bird to arc and fall again
4. WHEN the bird reaches the bottom of the screen THEN the game SHALL end

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to navigate through obstacles of varying heights, so that the game remains challenging and unpredictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game generates obstacles THEN each obstacle SHALL have a random height with a gap for the bird to pass through
2. WHEN obstacles appear THEN they SHALL move from right to left at a consistent speed
3. WHEN an obstacle moves off the left side of the screen THEN it SHALL be removed and a new obstacle SHALL be generated
4. WHEN the bird collides with any obstacle THEN the game SHALL end
5. WHEN the bird successfully passes through an obstacle gap THEN the player SHALL earn points

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my current score displayed in real-time, so that I can track my progress during the game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the score SHALL be displayed in the top right corner starting at 0
2. WHEN the bird successfully passes through an obstacle THEN the score SHALL increment by 1
3. WHEN the score changes THEN the display SHALL update immediately
4. WHEN the game is running THEN the score SHALL remain visible at all times

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my final score and have the option to restart when the game ends, so that I can try to improve my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bird collides with an obstacle or the ground THEN the game SHALL display a game over screen
2. WHEN the game over screen appears THEN it SHALL show the player's final score
3. WHEN the game over screen is displayed THEN it SHALL provide a restart button
4. WHEN the player clicks the restart button THEN the game SHALL reset to its initial state with score at 0
5. WHEN the game restarts THEN the bird SHALL return to its starting position and the obstacles SHALL be cleared

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want responsive controls for the bird, so that I can precisely time my jumps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player clicks anywhere on the game area THEN the bird SHALL jump upward
2. WHEN the player presses the spacebar THEN the bird SHALL jump upward
3. WHEN the player provides input THEN the bird SHALL respond immediately without delay
4. WHEN the game is paused or ended THEN input SHALL not affect the bird's movement

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth animations and visual feedback, so that the game feels polished and enjoyable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bird moves THEN its animation SHALL be smooth and fluid
2. WHEN obstacles move THEN they SHALL move smoothly across the screen
3. WHEN the bird jumps THEN there SHALL be a visual indication of the jump action
4. WHEN the game runs THEN it SHALL maintain a consistent frame rate for smooth gameplay
5. WHEN the bird collides with an obstacle THEN there SHALL be visual feedback indicating the collision
